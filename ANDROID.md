## Android
OpenSource operating system based on Linux kernel primarily used for mobile devices.

## Basic
#### Activity & Fragment
> Activity is a single screen or user interface of the app that the user can interact with. It's one of the basic building blocks of an Android app.
>
> Fragment is a modular section or part in an activity that is reusable and has its own lifecycle. We can combine multiple fragments to create an ui for a single screen

> Practice [Question](https://medium.com/@zayed007/android-activity-fragment-lifecycles-most-asked-interview-questions-and-answers-8dcb540bd3e)

#### Intents
> Messaging objects that are used to send data or perform some actions.
>
> - **Implicit:** Intents that do not specify any target or component, But instead a general action. for example, opening a URL.
> - **Explicit:** Intents that specify a target package or class. for example, starting a new activity.

#### IntentFilter
> Intent filters are used to filter out the type of intent the component will receive.

#### Services
> Services are used to run long-running tasks in the background even when a user is not interacting with the app.
>
> - **Started Service:** started using the `startService` method and runs even after closing the app.
> - **Bound Service:** binds to a component lifecycle and stops when the component dies.
> - **Foreground Service:** Special type of services that have UI components that users can interact with.  They show a notification to the user.

#### Broadcast & BroadcastReceivers
> System-wide events occur on Android devices that are broadcast to every app.
> BroadcastReceivers are classes used to receive these broadcast messages.

#### AndroidManifest
> xml file that contains all the information about the app such as package name, activities, services, etc.

#### Content Provider
> Content provider is used to store data that can be shared among different apps and provide an interface for the apps to access the data.

#### Android Tools
> - **Android SDK:** set of tools and libraries that are used to build Android applications.
> - **ADB:** commandline tool used to communicate with android devices & emulators.
> - **AAPT:** Android Asset Packaging Tool, is a command-line tool used to compile your app resources into a single binary file.
> - **Emulator:** used to emulate real Android devices in a computer, it provides a virtual environment to run Android apps.

#### Android OS Architecture
> - **Linux kernel:**  core of the Android system and provides the basic functionality, such as memory management, device drivers, and process scheduling.
> - **Android runtime (ART):** runtime environment for running android apps.
> - **Native libraries:** written in C or C++, provides low-level functionality, such as hardware access and graphics rendering.
> - **Android libraries:** provide a set of APIs that developers can use to develop Android apps.
> - **Android system apps:** pre-installed apps that come with every Android device.

#### Android Application Architecture
> 1. **Services**
> 1. **Activities**
> 1. **Fragments**
> 1. **Broadcast Receivers**
> 1. **Content Providers**

#### Context
> Context of the current state of the application/object. It allows access to application-specific resources and classes, as well as up-calls for application-level operations, such as launching activities, broadcasting and receiving intents, etc.

#### DDMS
> Dalvik Debug Monitor Server. is a tool that allows developers to monitor and debug Android applications running on emulators or connected devices.

#### Handling background tasks
> - **Service:** component in the Android system that runs in the background and performs long-running operations, such as playing music. A service can run indefinitely or be started and stopped on demand.
> - **IntentService:** type of service that can handle multiple requests on a separate worker thread in a queue. It automatically stops itself when the task is completed.
> - **JobScheduler:** system service that allows you to schedule background tasks to run at specific times or conditions, such as when the device is idle or connected to a charger.
> - **WorkManager:** library introduced in Android Jetpack that provides a simple and flexible way to schedule and manage background tasks in your app.

#### Handler, Asynctask, and Thread
> - **Handler:** class used to register to a thread and provides a simple channel to send data to this thread. Allows you to communicate back with the UI thread from other background threads.
> - **AsyncTask:** class encapsulates the creation of a background process and the synchronization with the main thread. It also supports reporting the progress of the running tasks.
> - **Thread:** core element of multithreading which a developer can use to perform background tasks.

#### Launch Modes
> - **Standard:** Creates a new instance of the activity every time, allowing multiple instances within the same task.
> - **SingleTop:** Reuses the existing instance if it's on top, calling onNewIntent(), or creates a new instance.
> - **SingleTask:** Ensures only one instance in a new or existing task, clearing activities above it in the stack.
> - **SingleInstance:** A unique task is created for the activity, allowing no other activities in the same task.

#### Runtime Permissions
> process where apps request specific permissions from the user while the app is running, typically in response to user actions, ensuring that sensitive device resources are accessed only with the user's explicit consent, enhancing security and privacy.

#### Strict Mode
> In Android in order to maintain a smooth experience of the app we've to do network and disk tasks in the background not in the main thread but there may be some mistake by the developer and some of those tasks are running on the main thread, So in order to find such operations strict mode is used.

#### Dalvik vs ART
| Dalvik | ART |
| ----| ---- |
| Just in Time (JIT) | Ahead of Time (AOT) |
| dex code was converted into machine code when we started the app | dex code was converted into machine code during the installation of the app |
| Low performance | High Performance |
| Faster Installation | Slow installation |

## Internal of popular libraries

#### MVVM
> MVVM is an Architectural design pattern that is used to separate business logic and the presentation logic of the UI.
> - **Model:** main logic of a program that contains that and is retrieved by the ViewModel.
> - **ViewModel:** defines properties and commands that can be used to bind data with views.
> - **View:** responsible for defining the layout, structure, and appearance of the UI.

#### Recycler Views
> Android UI component that allows us to create a scrolling list.
> - **Adapter:** Adapters are used to adapt data for individual items. It binds data with the viewholders.
> - **ViewHolder:** helper class that draws layouts for individual items
> - **LayoutManager:** used to position items within recycler views.
> - **ItemAnimator:** class to change the animation for the recycler view.

#### Room Database
> Android library that is part of jetpack components used for persistent storage that is made on the top of the SQLite database.
> - **Entity:** represents a table within the database, and each field acts as a column.
> - **Dao:** interface that is used to define database operations such as insert, delete, etc.
> - **Database:** responsible for creating the database and providing dao associated with the database.

#### Retrofit
> HTTP Client for Android applications that make network requests, and API handling easy.
> - **ApiService:** interface that defines the API endpoints and their HTTP methods.
> - **Retrofit:** responsible for creating and configuring the HTTP client, defining the base URL for the API, and creating instances of API interfaces.
> - **Response:** class that represents the API response.

#### Dependency Injection
> Dependency injection is a programming technique that makes a class independent of its dependencies. It achieves that by decoupling the usage of an object from its creation. In simple terms Dependency injection is basically providing the objects that an object needs (its dependencies) instead of having it construct them itself.
>
> In other words, Inversion of control principles says: class that is using the dependency should not create it. Instead, this dependency should be provided to the dependent. now DI is a pattern that shows how the dependencies are provided to fulfill inversion of control principle.

#### Optimize Recycler View Performance
> 1. Set a fixed width and height for images.
> 2. Use image-loading libraries like Glide, and Coil.
> 3. Do less work inside `onBindViewHolder`.
> 4. If the height of all items is equal set `hasFixedHeight` to `true`.
> 5. Use `RecycledViewPool` if nested recycler views have common views.
> 6. In case of the removal, the updation, or the addition of an item, use the Notify Item API.

#### Image Loading Library working
> So generally we do not cancel tasks like downloading, or bitmap decoding even when we even don't want them and that causes slow loading. To overcome this problem image loading libraries like Glide and others are aware of the lifecycle of activity/fragment cancel all the tasks that are not visible and load only images that are visible to the user. Libraries know about the lifecycle because of the context passed. These libraries also sample the image, for example for an image view 200x200 the library will downsample 2000x2000 to 200x200 so we can get the image required by the view, It also helps with `OutOfMemoryError`.

#### Grabage Collectorworking
> Garbage collection is the process by which Android programs perform automatic memory management using several GC algorithm e.g Mark and Sweep. So whenever an android application is started, it creates one memory tree considering starting object as tree root. Root create some other objects which can have its reference directly or indirectly, Now other objects are intantiated from these objects resulting in chain of references forming a memory tree.
>
> The Garbage collector starts from the tree root and traverse to all the nodes and mark it as `currently in use`, all the unmarked objects are not in use and are eligible for garbage collection.
>
> Now in some cases there are some objects that are still unused but marked as used that results in memory leak.

#### Hilt working
> Hilt is an Android dependency library that works on the dependency injection technique. It is developed by the Google and is made on the top of Dagger library. Hilts uses `Annotation Processors` to generate code.
>
> Annotation processing occurs within the compiler when converting java code to bytecode. 3 important annotations hilt uses are `AndroidEntryPoint`, `InstallIn`, & `HiltAndroidApp`
>
> - **HiltAndroidApp**
> enables injection in your Android application class. It generates a set of components inside of a wrapper class that has the same name as the application class.
> - **AndroidEntryPoint**
> enables field injection in your Android classes such as Activities, Fragments, Views, and Services. This generates class necessay for injection. The injection should be done as early as possible.
> - **InstallIn** 
> indicate which component a module or entry point should be installed into.
>
> [For Better Understanding](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/mad-skills-series-hilt-under-the-hood-9d89ee227059)

#### Koin working
> Koin is another popular DI library for android, It follow different approach than Dagger as it follows `Service locator` pattern instead of dependency injection. Koin don't need any `annotations` nor it generates any code because we provide all modules with the `factories` that is used to create instance of classes. The references of all the factories are added to Koin `Instances Register` class. When we use `get` method or `inject` property koin search for respected factory using a key i.e. full class name and creates an instance.

#### Why Koin don't follows DI?
> Because according to the Dependency Injection pattern, classes should never know where the dependencies come from and should never request for the dependencies themselves.
> All the dependencies should rather be provided to the class. And because Koin does not meet those criteria, it’s said that instead of following Dependency Injection pattern it rather follows the Service Locator pattern.

## Android Testing
Android testing is an integral part of the Android development process, By running tests we can check for app compatibility, performance, accessibility, and correction.

#### Types of testing in Android
> 1. Functional testing: does my app do what it's supposed to?
> 1. Performance testing: does it do it quickly and efficiently?
> 1. Accessibility testing: does it work well with accessibility services?
> 1. Compatibility testing: does it work well on every device and API level?

#### Good testing Strategy
> In real-world scenarios we've to test each and every line of the code, it is not practically possible but instead, we should maintain a balance between testing speed and reliability. By using a good testing architecture and decoupling classes we can create more smaller tests for specific components of the app.

#### Flaky tests
> Some tests sometimes fail and do not pass all the time due to some runtime conditions or other factors like auto updation, Those tests are called flaky tests.

#### Organization of Tests
> **androidTest** Contains the tests that run on a virtual or physical device. Includes integration, and end-to-end tests where JVM alone can't test the functionality.
> **test** Contains unit tests that can run locally on JVM.

#### What to test
> Unit Test:
>  - ViewModels, Presenters, Repositories, UseCases, Utility Classes.
>  - Normal Cases, Edge Cases, Boundry Conditions.
>
> UI Test:
>  - Screen UI tests such as Clicking of buttons, and typing in forms.
>  - User flow tests or navigation tests.

#### Local Unit Test
> Local unit tests are unit tests that run locally on JVM and do not require any physical device, or emulator. They are used to verify the behavior of a small section of the program by checking the results. They are placed in `module-name/src/test/`. These tests can not interact with Android framework APIs which makes them limited to the variety of tests we can perform.

#### testImplementation and androidTestImplementation
> Used to add dependencies testImplementation for local tests and androidTestImplementation adds dependencies for Instrumented tests. They are placed in `module-name/src/androidTest/java/`.

#### Instrumental test
> Tests that are run on Physical devices or Emulators, and can interact with Android framework APIs which makes them more real than local tests but slower. These are run in the special environment which gives them access to the instance of the `instrumentation` class.
>
> PS: UI tests are Instrumental tests

#### Instrumentation
> Base class for implementing instrumentation code. This allows to monitor all of the interactions between the system and the application.

## Memory Leaks
> Memory leaks occurs when app holds on to an object that is no longer needed, and garbage collector can not reclaim the memory by freeing up that object because the object is still reachable.

#### Common Causes & Prevenention

> **Inner Classes and Anonymous Classes**
>  when inner classes hold references to the enclosing classes, it can cause memory leak. this happens because Non-static inner classes and anonymous classes have an implicit reference to the outer class instance. If the inner class has a longer lifecycle than the outer class, it keeps the outer class in memory longer than necessary.
> 
> **Handlers and Runnables**
> If handler posts a runnable with longer delay and activity/fragment destorys, the delayed execution can prevent activity/fragment to be garbage collected, to prevent this we should use static inner classes or different classes with weak reference for activity/fragment and cancelling all taks in onDestroy using `handler.removeCallbacks(runnable)`.
>
> **Static Views or Contexts**
> Static classes holds `long-lived references` which are tied to the class itself not the instance of class that means it will hold as long as class is loaded i.e. mostly till app is running. One way to prevent is to use local references or if passing context we can use weak references.
>
> **Improper LiveData Observations**
> The most cause of this is when observers are registered incorrectly. like passing `this` as lifecycle owner, which ties to fragment/activity overall lifecycle. The recommended approach is to use `viewLifecycleOwner` because it start from `onCreateView` to `onDestroyView`.
>  [Better Explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59521748/16177121)
>
> **Singleton with Context**
> Same as static views, Singletons are also `long-lived` nature. To prevent this when passing context in Singleton pass `applicationContext` instead of fragment/activity because they also live long as application.
>
> **Bitmaps**
> One of most common cause of memory leaks are `bitmaps` as bitmaps because of there large size. Also improper recycling of `bitmaps` causes `OutOfMemoryError`. There are multiple ways to prevent this one easiest way is to use image-loading libraries like glide. another way is to resizing bitmaps to required size and recycling bitmaps on `onDestroy`.
>
> **Webviews**
> Webviews have different lifecycle then from the fragment/activity they are in, so even when the fragment/activity destroyed webviews an still hold there context, one way to prevent this is properly destroy webviews in `onDestroy` of activity/fragment.
>
> **Broadcast recievers**
> Using Broadcast recievers as anonymous class or not unregistering broadcast recivers can cause memory leaks. The proper way is to define seperate class and properly registering and unregistering broadcast recivers.
>
> **Event Listeners in Recycler view adapters**
> If listeners holds the context of fragment/activity it will cause memory leaks, If required use `parent.context` instead and detaching listeners in `onViewRecycled`.

#### WeakReferences
> WeakReference wrapper class which instructions to the GC collector that it needs to clear following variable because it has a weak reference with its container so whenever its original scope is no longer available in memory it is flagged to be collected.

#### Impact of Memory leak
> - whenever memory leak happens there is shortage of memory resulting android calling garbage collector more frequently which ends in resulting lower performance.
> - GC events are stop-the-world events which means when GC happens, the rendering of UI and processing of events will stop.
> _When minor GCs will not be able to reclaim the memory, system will force a larger GC to kick off, which pauses the entire application main thread for around 50ms to 100ms. Since, Android has a 16ms drawing window and GC takes long than that, Android will start losing frames and lagging seriously._
> 
> - if gc still can't reclaim memory then heap of app will increase which at one time leads to `OutOfMemoryError`.
